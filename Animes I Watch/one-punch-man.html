    <h1>One Punch Man</h1>
    <p>One Punch Man is a satirical superhero anime and manga series created by ONE and illustrated by Yusuke Murata. It follows Saitama, a seemingly ordinary man who becomes a hero for fun. After intense training, he gains the power to defeat any opponent with a single punch, leaving him bored and unfulfilled. Despite his unmatched strength, Saitama struggles with mundane problems, like gaining recognition in the Hero Association and finding worthy challenges. The series blends over-the-top action, absurd humor, and sharp commentary on superhero tropes, while also featuring a colorful cast of characters, including the ambitious cyborg Genos and countless quirky heroes and villains. One Punch Man masterfully balances epic fights with its comedic exploration of what it means to be a hero.</p>
